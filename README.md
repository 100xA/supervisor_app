# Requirements/User Stories

The supervisors of final theses at IU want to improve their supervision processes with an app. To this end, they have outlined the following user stories:

- [ ] As a student, I want to be able to find out which supervisor fits my topic.

- [ ] As a supervisor, I want to be able to announce topics for final theses to pursue my research interests further. 3.
- [ ] As a student, I want to be able to contact a supervisor to send them my proposal and arrange for supervision.

- [ ] As a supervisor, I want to have an overview of the theses I am supervising and their status (in discussion, registered, submitted, colloquium held) so I don't lose track.

- [ ] As a supervisor, I want to be able to find and assign a second reviewer for each thesis.
- [ ] As a second reviewer, I want to have an overview of all the theses for which I have been registered as a second reviewer.

- [ ] As a supervisor and second reviewer, I want to know for which theses I have already submitted an invoice and which invoices have been paid, to keep track of the billing.
